# My Spot

As it currently stands, when schools tie up with NPOs to conduct community service events/activities, the onus lies on the teacher to not only source, but heavily manage the proceedings of the event/activity. This CRM app is therefore created to allow teachers to collaborate with NPOs on the activites to be conducted during events, as well as to manage the student sign up, and post-event student reflection.

Built on:
  - Rails

Functionality:
  - Login/Signup
  - NGO/Teacher approval
  - Edit events/tasks
